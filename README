leafdigital picstory is a Java web application that serves picture stories.
A picture story is a way to display your photographs along with text. 

You create one or more picture stories to serve with this software. Each
picture story is a subfolder inside a single story root folder. The subfolder
contains the story text XML file index.xml, and a number of .jpg files with
the pictures for the story.
